# Clustering extremely large-scale Distribution Networks
## Bottom-Up Travers Clustering Algorithm 

This repository contains sources code related to the proposed bottom-up traverse clustering algorithm. The algorithm considers the graph model of the distribution networks and starts traversing from the leaves if the graph and assign a number to each node. The overall details and pseudocode of the proposed algorithm has been described in [IEEE Transaction Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9612596).

> This repository constrains a source-code of the proposed algorithm which is required to connect with OpenDSS COM in order to get the data of any related distribution networks.
